## create a folder for CDK App (folder name is important as used by the CDK setup and deploy code (can be changed but need to align for deploy to work)) ##
mkdir cdk-vpc
cd cdk-vpc

## Initialise CDK ##
cdk init app --language python

source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## configure deploy ##
replace cdk_vpc/cdk_vpc_stack.py with cdk_vpc_stack.py in this repos (either entire file or just its contents)


## deploy VPC ##
cdk synth - outputs calculated CloudFormation template

cdk deploy - deploys new template
